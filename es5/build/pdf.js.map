Include the trailing slash.\n * @property {boolean} [cMapPacked] - Specifies if the Adobe CMaps are binary\n *   packed or not.\n * @property {Object} [CMapReaderFactory] - The factory that will be used when\n *   reading built-in CMap files. Providing a custom factory is useful for\n *   environments without Fetch API or `XMLHttpRequest` support, such as\n *   Node.js. The default value is {DOMCMapReaderFactory}.\n * @property {boolean} [stopAtErrors] - Reject certain promises, e.g.\n *   `getOperatorList`, `getTextContent`, and `RenderTask`, when the associated\n *   PDF data cannot be successfully parsed, instead of attempting to recover\n *   whatever possible of the data. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {number} [maxImageSize] - The maximum allowed image size in total\n *   pixels, i.e. width * height. Images above this value will not be rendered.\n *   Use -1 for no limit, which is also the default value.\n * @property {boolean} [isEvalSupported] - Determines if we can evaluate strings\n *   as JavaScript. Primarily used to improve performance of font rendering, and\n *   when parsing PDF functions. The default value is `true`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableFontFace] - By default fonts are converted to\n *   OpenType fonts and loaded via `@font-face` rules. If disabled, fonts will\n *   be rendered using a built-in font renderer that constructs the glyphs with\n *   primitive path commands. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [fontExtraProperties] - Include additional properties,\n *   which are unused during rendering of PDF documents, when exporting the\n *   parsed font data from the worker-thread. This may be useful for debugging\n *   purposes (and backwards compatibility), but note that it will lead to\n *   increased memory usage. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {HTMLDocument} [ownerDocument] - Specify an explicit document\n *   context to create elements with and to load resources, such as fonts,\n *   into. Defaults to the current document.\n * @property {boolean} [disableRange] - Disable range request loading of PDF\n *   files. When enabled, and if the server supports partial content requests,\n *   then the PDF will be fetched in chunks. The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableStream] - Disable streaming of PDF file data.\n *   By default PDF.js attempts to load PDF files in chunks. The default value\n *   is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} [disableAutoFetch] - Disable pre-fetching of PDF file\n *   data. When range requests are enabled PDF.js will automatically keep\n *   fetching more data even if it isn't needed to display the current page.\n *   The default value is `false`.\n *\n *   NOTE: It is also necessary to disable streaming, see above, in order for\n *   disabling of pre-fetching to work correctly.\n * @property {boolean} [pdfBug] - Enables special hooks for debugging PDF.js\n *   (see `web/debugger.js`). The default value is `false`.\n */\n\n/**\n * @typedef {Object} PDFDocumentStats\n * @property {Object<string, boolean>} streamTypes - Used stream types in the\n *   document (an item is set to true if specific stream ID was used in the\n *   document).\n * @property {Object<string, boolean>} fontTypes - Used font types in the\n *   document (an item is set to true if specific font ID was used in the\n *   document).\n */\n\n/**\n * This is the main entry point for loading a PDF and interacting with it.\n *\n * NOTE: If a URL is used to fetch the PDF data a standard Fetch API call (or\n * XHR as fallback) is used, which means it must follow same origin rules,\n * e.g. no cross-domain requests without CORS.\n *\n * @param {string|TypedArray|DocumentInitParameters|PDFDataRangeTransport} src -\n *   Can be a URL to where a PDF file is located, a typed array (Uint8Array)\n *   already populated with data or parameter object.\n * @returns {PDFDocumentLoadingTask}\n */\nfunction getDocument(src) {\n  const task = new PDFDocumentLoadingTask();\n\n  let source;\n  if (typeof src === \"string\") {\n    source = { url: src };\n  } else if (isArrayBuffer(src)) {\n    source = { data: src };\n  } else if (src instanceof PDFDataRangeTransport) {\n    source = { range: src };\n  } else {\n    if (typeof src !== \"object\") {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter in getDocument, \" +\n          \"need either Uint8Array, string or a parameter object\"\n      );\n    }\n    if (!src.url && !src.data && !src.range) {\n      throw new Error(\n        \"Invalid parameter object: need either .data, .range or .url\"\n      );\n    }\n    source = src;\n  }\n  const params = Object.create(null);\n  let rangeTransport = null,\n    worker = null;\n\n  for (const key in source) {\n    if (key === \"url\" && typeof window !== \"undefined\") {\n      // The full path is required in the 'url' field.\n      params[key] = new URL(source[key], window.location).href;\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"range\") {\n      rangeTransport = source[key];\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"worker\") {\n      worker = source[key];\n      continue;\n    } else if (key === \"data\" && !(source[key] instanceof Uint8Array)) {\n      // Converting string or array-like data to Uint8Array.\n      const pdfBytes = source[key];\n      if (typeof pdfBytes === \"string\") {\n        params[key] = stringToBytes(pdfBytes);\n      } else if (\n        typeof pdfBytes === \"object\" &&\n        pdfBytes !== null &&\n        !isNaN(pdfBytes.length)\n      ) {\n        params[key] = new Uint8Array(pdfBytes);\n      } else if (isArrayBuffer(pdfBytes)) {\n        params[key] = new Uint8Array(pdfBytes);\n      } else {\n        throw new Error(\n          \"Invalid PDF binary data: either typed array, \" +\n            \"string or array-like object is expected in the \" +\n            \"data property.\"\n        );\n      }\n      continue;\n    }\n    params[key] = source[key];\n  }\n\n  params.rangeChunkSize = params.rangeChunkSize || DEFAULT_RANGE_CHUNK_SIZE;\n  params.CMapReaderFactory =\n    params.CMapReaderFactory || DefaultCMapReaderFactory;\n  params.ignoreErrors = params.stopAtErrors !== true;\n  params.fontExtraProperties = params.fontExtraProperties === true;\n  params.pdfBug = params.pdfBug === true;\n\n  if (!Number.isInteger(params.maxImageSize)) {\n    params.maxImageSize = -1;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.isEvalSupported !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.isEvalSupported = true;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableFontFace !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableFontFace = apiCompatibilityParams.disableFontFace || false;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.ownerDocument === \"undefined\") {\n    params.ownerDocument = globalThis.document;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof params.disableRange !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableRange = false;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableStream !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableStream = false;\n  }\n  if (typeof params.disableAutoFetch !== \"boolean\") {\n    params.disableAutoFetch = false;\n  }\n\n  // Set the main-thread verbosity level.\n  setVerbosityLevel(params.verbosity);\n\n  if (!worker) {\n    const workerParams = {\n      verbosity: params.verbosity,\n      port: GlobalWorkerOptions.workerPort,\n    };\n    // Worker was not provided -- creating and owning our own.
